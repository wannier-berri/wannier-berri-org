abstract={Discoveries of topological states and topological materials have reshaped our understanding of physics and materials over the past 15 years. First-principles calculations have had an important role in bridging the theory of topology and experiments by predicting realistic topological materials. In this Review, we offer an overview of the first-principles methodology on topological quantum materials. First, we unify different concepts of topological states in the same band inversion scenario. We then discuss the topology using first-principles band structures and newly established topological materials databases. We stress challenges in characterizing symmetry-independent Weyl semimetals and calculating topological surface states, closing with an outlook on the exciting transport and optical phenomena induced by the topology. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={We present efficient methods for Brillouin zone integration with a non-zero but possibly very small broadening factor η, focusing on cases in which downfolded Hamiltonians can be evaluated efficiently using Wannier interpolation. We describe robust, high-order accurate algorithms automating convergence to a user-specified error tolerance ϵ, emphasizing an efficient computational scaling with respect to η. After analyzing the standard equispaced integration method, applicable in the case of large broadening, we describe a simple iterated adaptive integration algorithm effective in the small η regime. Its computational cost scales as O(log3(η-1)) as η → 0+ in three dimensions, as opposed to O(η-3) for equispaced integration. We argue that, by contrast, tree-based adaptive integration methods scale only as O(log(η-1)/η2) for typical Brillouin zone integrals. In addition to its favorable scaling, the iterated adaptive algorithm is straightforward to implement, particularly for integration on the irreducible Brillouin zone, for which it avoids the tetrahedral meshes required for tree-based schemes. We illustrate the algorithms by calculating the spectral function of SrVO3 with broadening on the meV scale. © 2023 Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Strong-field phenomena in solids exhibit extreme high-order nonlinear optical effects, which have triggered many theoretical and experimental investigations. However, there is still a lack of highly efficient numerical tools to simulate the relevant phenomena. In this paper, a versatile multiscale numerical tool set is developed for studying high-order nonlinear optical effects in solids, generated by ultrafast strong laser pulses. This tool is based on the tight-binding model approximation of the crystal structure, the related parameters of which are obtained from the density functional theory calculations. And the nonlinear effects are explored by solving the Maxwell equations coupled with the semiconductor Bloch equations. Our numerical tool can provide not only basic electronic structures and optical responses of the crystal, but also the real-time evolution of the macroscopic electromagnetic fields and the current density. The high-performance parallel computing and the interpolation method in our tool make it possible to study the strong-field nonlinear responses and propagation effects on a large spatial and temporal scale. Finally, three theoretical or experimental results published recently are satisfactorily reproduced, showing a good performance of the current toolbox. © 2022 American Physical Society.},
