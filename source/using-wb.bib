abstract={Multiple works suggest the possibility of classification of quantum spin Hall effect with magnetic flux tubes, which cause separation of spin and charge degrees of freedom and pumping of spin or Kramers-pair. However, the proof of principle demonstration of spin-charge separation is yet to be accomplished for realistic, ab initio band structures of spin-orbit-coupled materials, lacking spin-conservation law. In this work, we perform thought experiments with magnetic flux tubes on β -bismuthene, and demonstrate spin-charge separation, and quantized pumping of spin for three insulating states, that can be accessed by tuning filling fractions. With a combined analysis of momentum-space topology and real-space response, we identify important role of bands supporting even integer invariants, which cannot be addressed with symmetry-based indicators. Our work sets a new standard for the computational diagnosis of two-dimensional, quantum spin-Hall materials by going beyond the Z2 paradigm and providing an avenue for precise determination of the bulk invariant through computation of quantized, real-space response. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={A bulk material without inversion symmetry can generate a direct current under illumination. This interface-free current generation mechanism, referred to as the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), does not rely on p-n junctions. Here, we explore the shift current generation, a major mechanism responsible for the BPVE, in single-element two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics represented by phosphorene-like monolayers of As, Sb, and Bi. The strong covalency, small band gap, and large joint density of states afforded by these elemental 2D materials give rise to large shift currents, outperforming many state-of-the-art materials. We find that the shift current, due to its topological nature, depends sensitively on the details of the Bloch wave functions. It is crucial to consider the electronic exchange-correlation potential beyond the generalized gradient approximation as well as the spin-orbit interaction in density functional theory calculations to obtain reliable frequency-dependent shift current responses. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={Chern insulators are two-dimensional magnetic topological materials that conduct electricity along their edges via the one-dimensional chiral modes. The number of these modes is a topological invariant called the first Chern number C that defines the quantized Hall conductance as Sx y = C e 2/h. Increasing C is pivotal for the realization of low-power-consumption topological electronics, but there has been no clear-cut solution to this problem so far, with the majority of existing Chern insulators showing C = 1. Here, by using state-of-the-art theoretical methods, we propose an efficient approach for the realization of the high-C state in MnBi2Te4/hBN van der Waals multilayer heterostructures. We show that a stack of n MnBi2Te4 films with C = 1 intercalated by hBN monolayers gives rise to a high Chern number state with C = n, characterized by n chiral edge modes. This state can be achieved both under the external magnetic field and without it, both cases leading to the quantized Hall conductance Sx y = C e 2/h. Our results, therefore, pave the way to practical high-C quantized Hall systems. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={In this work, we shed light on the mechanism behind the complexity of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) compound. To achieve a comprehensive picture, we first theoretically investigate the pure elemental metals and observe that the AHE of RE Gd is negative while that of TM Co is positive. We then investigate magnetic properties and AHE behavior for two typical cases of TM-rich and RE-rich compositions that correspond to GdCo5 and GdCo3 alloys, respectively. The observation that net magnetization is not a decisive factor in assessing the AHE value is consistent with recent claims. Besides, our investigations reveal a significant role of the Gd sublattice to the AHE. The reduction AHE signal under a high-applied field is attributed to the counteraction between the positive and negative AHC contributions when the TM and RE sub-moments are aligned parallel. On a bright note, our new findings can be successfully employed to unravel two types of aberrant humps of AHE signals near compensation temperature. © 2023 Author(s).},

Nevertheless, details on the electronic structure, related to the oxidation states and the octahedral center's site effects, are still scarce. Here, we show a theoretical study, based on first-principles calculations in the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), on the electronic properties associated with the nitrogen site effects on the structural, electronic, magnetic, and topological degrees of freedom. Thus, we show that the nitrogen vacancy increases the value of the anomalous Hall conductivity and retains the chiral Γ4g antiferromagnetic ordering. Moreover, we reveal, based on the Bader charges and the electronic structure analysis, the negative and positive oxidation states of the Ni- and Mn-sites, respectively. This is in agreement with the expected A3α+Bβ−Xδ− oxidation states to satisfy charge neutrality in antiperovskites, but the negative charge is rare for transition metals. Finally, we extrapolate our findings on the oxidation states to several Mn3BN compounds, showing that the antiperovskite structure is an ideal platform to encounter negative oxidation states for metals sitting at the corner B-sites. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Achieving large-scale growth of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials with high Curie temperature TC and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is highly desirable for the development of ultracompact magnetic sensors and magnetic memories. In this context, van der Waals (vdW) Cr2Te3 appears to be a promising candidate. Bulk Cr2Te3 exhibits strong PMA and a TC of 180 K. Moreover, both PMA and TC might be adjusted in ultrathin films by engineering composition or strain or applying an electric field. In this work, we demonstrate the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of vdW heterostructures of five-monolayer quasifreestanding Cr2Te3 on three classes of 2D materials: graphene (semimetal), WSe2 (semiconductor), and Bi2Te3 (topological insulator). By combining structural and chemical analysis down to the atomic level with ab initio calculations, we confirm the single-crystalline character of Cr2Te3 films on the 2D materials with sharp vdW interfaces. They all exhibit PMA and TC close to the bulk Cr2Te3 value of 180 K. Ab initio calculations confirm this PMA and show how its strength depends on strain. Finally, Hall measurements reveal a strong anomalous Hall effect, which changes sign at a given temperature. We theoretically explain this effect by a sign change of the Berry phase close to the Fermi level. This transition temperature depends on the 2D material in proximity, notably as a consequence of charge transfer. MBE-grown Cr2Te3/2D material bilayers constitute model systems for the further development of spintronic devices combining PMA, large spin-orbit coupling, and sharp vdW interface. © 2023 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Charge transport plays a crucial role in manifold potential applications of two-dimensional materials, including field-effect transistors, solar cells, and transparent conductors. At most operating temperatures, charge transport is hindered by scattering of carriers by lattice vibrations. Assessing the intrinsic phonon-limited carrier mobility is thus of paramount importance to identify promising candidates for next-generation devices. Here we provide a framework to efficiently compute the drift and Hall carrier mobility of two-dimensional materials through the Boltzmann transport equation by relying on a Fourier-Wannier interpolation. Building on a recent formulation of long-range contributions to dynamical matrices and phonon dispersions [Phys. Rev. X 11, 041027 (2021)2160-330810.1103/PhysRevX.11.041027], we extend the approach to electron-phonon coupling including the effect of dynamical dipoles and quadrupoles. We identify an unprecedented contribution associated with the Berry connection that is crucial to preserve the Wannier-gauge covariance of the theory. This contribution is not specific to two-dimensional crystals, but also concerns the three-dimensional case, as we demonstrate via an application to bulk SrO. We showcase our method on a wide selection of relevant monolayers ranging from SnS2 to MoS2, graphene, BN, InSe, and phosphorene. We also discover a nontrivial temperature evolution of the Hall hole mobility in InSe whereby the mobility increases with temperature above 150 K due to the Mexican-hat electronic structure of the InSe valence bands. Overall, we find that dynamical quadrupoles are essential and can impact the carrier mobility in excess of 75%. © 2023 American Physical Society.},

However, they typically have a high carrier density and a complicated band structure near the Fermi energy. In this Letter, we report a degenerate magnetic semiconductor EuMg2Bi2, which exhibits a single valley at the Γ point, where field-tunable Weyl points form via a magnetic exchange interaction with the local Eu spins. By the high-field measurements on high-quality single crystals, we observed quantum oscillations in the resistivity, elastic constant, and surface impedance, which enabled us to determine the position of the Fermi energy EF. In combination with a first-principles calculation, we revealed that the Weyl points are located in the vicinity of EF when the Eu spins are fully polarized, leading to a peak of energy-dependent anomalous Hall conductivity due to the Berry curvature. Accordingly, in the forced ferromagnetic phase, we observed a large anomalous Hall effect (Hall angle ΘAH∼0.07) qualitatively consistent with the calculation, which demonstrates a marked impact of the Weyl points in the simple band structure. © 2023 American Physical Society.},

Here, we present a first-principles theoretical characterization of the electronic topology of the antiferromagnetic half-Heusler alloy DyPdBi. In the antiferromagnetic state preserving C3v symmetry of the crystal, DyPdBi is a triple-point semimetal hosting four triply degenerate nodes along the threefold symmetry axis of the Brillouin zone. In contrast, the antiferromagnetic state of DyPdBi with local magnetic moments on Dy rotated to a direction perpendicular to the C3 axis breaks the threefold rotational symmetry, and hosts four Weyl nodes in its Brillouin zone. Our calculations of the Berry curvature of their electronic states clearly show that the triple-point fermions of DyPdBi exhibit a signature peak in the anomalous Hall conductivity, while the Weyl fermions do not contribute to anomalous Hall conductivity. As these two topologically distinct magnetic states are separated by a small energy difference of ≈15 meV, we expect them to be switchable with a magnetic field or spin torque and distinguishable experimentally from anomalous Hall conductance. © 2023 American Physical Society.},

The ab initio calculated electronic structure of these Janus structures, show giant Rashba effect with Rashba coefficients as large as ≈25eVÅ.

abstract={Spin-charge interconversion (SCI) is a central phenomenon to the development of spintronic devices from materials with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the case of materials with high crystal symmetry, the only allowed SCI processes are those where the spin-current, charge-current, and spin-polarization directions are orthogonal to each other. Consequently, standard SCI experiments are designed to maximize the signals arising from the SCI processes with conventional mutually orthogonal geometry. However, in low-symmetry materials, certain nonorthogonal SCI processes are also allowed. Since the standard SCI experiment is limited to charge current flowing only in one direction in the SOC material, certain allowed SCI configurations remain unexplored. Here, we perform a thorough SCI study in a graphene-based lateral spin valve combined with low-symmetry MoTe2. Due to a very low contact resistance between the two materials, we can detect SCI signals using both a standard configuration, where the charge current is applied along MoTe2, and a recently introduced [three-dimensional- (3D) current] configuration, where the charge-current flow can be controlled in three directions within the heterostructure. As a result, we observe three different SCI components, one orthogonal and two nonorthogonal, adding valuable insight into the SCI processes in low-symmetry materials. The large SCI signals obtained at room temperature, along with the versatility of the 3D-current configuration, provide feasibility and flexibility to the design of the next generation of spin-based devices. © 2023 American Physical Society.},

Especially their anomalous Hall conductivity, which can be controlled by applied strain and/or electric field, makes them highly attractive in different electronic applications. Here, we present the study and theoretical understanding of an antiperovskite compound that can offer enormous opportunities in a broad set of applications. Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the structure, lattice dynamics, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and electronic behavior in the vanadium-based antiperovskite V3AuN. We found an antiperovskite structure centered on N similar to the Mn3AN family as the structural ground state. In such a phase, a Pm3¯m ground state was found in contrast to the Cmcm post-antiperovskite layered structure, as in the V3AN, A=Ga, Ge, As, and P. We studied the lattice dynamics and electronic properties, demonstrating its vibrational stability in the cubic structure and a chiral antiferromagnetic noncollinear ordering as a magnetic ground state. Finally, we found that the anomalous Hall conductivity, associated with the topological features induced by the magnetic symmetry, is σxy=-291Scm-1 (σ111=-504Scm-1).

abstract={Antiferromagnetic manganese-based nitride antiperovskites, such as Mn3NiN, hold a triangular frustrated magnetic ordering, thanks to their kagome lattice formed by the Mn atoms along the (111) plane. As such, the magnetic frustration imposes a nontrivial interplay between the symmetric and asymmetric magnetic interactions, which can only reach equilibrium in a noncollinear magnetic configuration. Consequently, the associated electronic interactions and their possible tuning by external constraints, such as applied epitaxial strain, play a crucial role in defining the microscopic and macroscopic properties of such topological condensed matter systems. In this paper, we explored and explained the effect of the epitaxial strain imposed within the (111) plane, in which the magnetic and crystallographic symmetry operations are kept fixed, and only the magnitude of the ionic and electronic interactions are tuned. We found a tangible enhancement in the anomalous Hall conductivity along the (111) plane (σ111AHE) for compression values, whereas, for tension, the AHC is dramatically reduced. As such, the σ111AHE component fetches a maximum increase of 26%, with respect to the unstrained structure, for a compression value close to -1.5%. Our findings indicate a distinct correlation between the anomalous Hall conductivity and the Berry curvature along the (111) plane as a function of the strain. Here, the nondivergent Berry curvature acts as the source and the strain as the control mechanism of this anomalous transport phenomenon. © 2022 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The linear positive magnetoresistance (LPMR) is a widely observed phenomenon in topological materials, which is promising for potential applications on topological spintronics. However, its mechanism remains ambiguous yet, and the effect is thus uncontrollable. Here, we report a quantitative scaling model that correlates the LPMR with the Berry curvature, based on a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal CoS2 that bears the largest LPMR of over 500% at 2 K and 9 T, among known magnetic topological semimetals. In this system, masses of Weyl nodes existing near the Fermi level, revealed by theoretical calculations, serve as Berry-curvature monopoles and low-effective-mass carriers. Based on the Weyl picture, we propose a relation MR = eh BΩ F, with B being the applied magnetic field and ΩF the average Berry curvature near the Fermi surface, and further introduce temperature factor to both MR/B slope (MR per unit field) and anomalous Hall conductivity, which establishes the connection between the model and experimental measurements. A clear picture of the linearly slowing down of carriers, i.e., the LPMR effect, is demonstrated under the cooperation of the k-space Berry curvature and real-space magnetic field. Our study not only provides experimental evidence of Berry curvature-induced LPMR but also promotes the common understanding and functional designing of the large Berry-curvature MR in topological Dirac/Weyl systems for magnetic sensing or information storage. © 2022 the Author(s).},

abstract={In the presence of time reversal symmetry, a non-linear Hall effect can occur in systems without an inversion symmetry. One of the prominent candidates for detection of such Hall signals are Weyl semimetals. In this article, we investigate the Berry curvature induced second and third order Hall effect in multi-Weyl semimetals with topological charges n=1,2,3 . We use low energy effective models to obtain general analytical expressions and discover the presence of a large Berry curvature dipole (BCD) in multi-Weyl semimetals, compared to usual (n = 1) Weyl semimetals. We also study the BCD in a realistic tight-binding lattice model and observe two different kinds of variation with increasing topological charge - these can be attributed to different underlying Berry curvature components. We provide estimates of the signatures of second harmonic of Hall signal in multi-Weyl semimetals, which can be detected experimentally. Furthermore, we predict the existence of a third order Hall signal in multi-Weyl semimetals. We derive the analytical expressions of Berry connection polarizability tensor, which is responsible for third order effects, using a low energy model and estimate the measurable conductivity. Our work can help guide experimental discovery of Berry curvature multipole physics in multi-Weyl semimetals. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Many physical quantities in solid-state physics are calculated from k-space summation. For spectral functions, the frequency-dependent factor can be decomposed into the energy-conserving δ-function part and the nondissipative principal value part. A very useful scheme for this k-space summation is the tetrahedron method. Tetrahedron methods have been widely used to calculate the summation of the energy-conserving δ-function part, such as the imaginary part of the dielectric function. On the other hand, the corresponding tetrahedron method for the nondissipative part, such as the real part of the dielectric function has not been used much. In this paper, we address the technical difficulties in the tetrahedron method for the nondissipative part and present an easy-to-implement stable method to overcome those difficulties. We demonstrate our method by calculating the static and dynamical spin Hall conductivity of platinum. Our method can be widely applied to calculate linear static or dynamical conductivity, self-energy of an electron, and electric polarizability, to name a few. © 2022 American Physical Society.},

abstract={The anomalous Hall effect in time-reversal symmetry broken systems is underpinned by the concept of Berry curvature in band theory. However, recent experiments reveal that the nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can be observed in non-magnetic systems without applying an external magnetic field. The emergence of NHE under time-reversal symmetric conditions can be explained in terms of non-vanishing Berry curvature dipole (BCD) arising from inversion symmetry breaking. In this work, we availed realistic tight-binding models, first-principles calculations, and symmetry analyses to explore the combined effect of transverse electric field and strain, which leads to a giant BCD in the elemental buckled honeycomb lattices—silicene, germanene, and stanene. The external electric field breaks the inversion symmetry of these systems, while strain helps to attain an asymmetrical distribution of Berry curvature of a single valley. Furthermore, the topology of the electronic wavefunction switches from the band inverted quantum spin Hall state to normal insulating one at the gapless point. This band gap closing at the critical electric field strength is accompanied by an enhanced Berry curvature and concomitantly a giant BCD at the Fermi level. Our results predict the occurrence of an electrically switchable nonlinear electrical and thermal Hall effect in a new class of elemental systems that can be experimentally verified. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The effects rely on a conserved spin current passing between a reference and a sensing ferromagnetic electrode in a multilayer structure. Recently, we have proposed that these fundamental spintronic effects can be realized in unconventional collinear antiferromagnets with nonrelativistic alternating spin-momentum coupling. Here, we elaborate on the proposal by presenting archetype model mechanisms for the giant and tunneling magnetoresistance effects in multilayers composed of these unconventional collinear antiferromagnets. The models are based, respectively, on anisotropic and valley-dependent forms of the alternating spin-momentum coupling. Using first-principles calculations, we link these model mechanisms to real materials and predict an approximately 100% scale for the effects. We point out that, besides the giant or tunneling magnetoresistance detection, the alternating spin-momentum coupling can allow for magnetic excitation by the spin-transfer torque. © 2022 authors.

We find that noncoplanar antiferromagnetic ordering is favored relative to collinear or coplanar order in the case of M = Co, Fe, and Ni, while ferromagnetic ordering is favored in MnNb3S6 at low temperatures. The AHC in these materials with noncoplanar spin ordering can reach about e2/h per crystalline layer, while being negligible for coplanar and collinear cases. We also find that the AHC depends sensitively on doping and reaches a maximum for intermediate values of the local spin exchange potential between 0.3 and 0.8 eV. Our AHC results are consistent with the reported Hall measurements in CoNb3S6 and suggest a possibility of similarly large anomalous Hall effects in related compounds. © 2022 American Physical Society.},

The Rietveld analysis of high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction data reveals a large degree (∼50%) of antisite disorder between Fe and Al atoms. The analysis of anomalous transport data provides the experimental anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) about 227 S/cm at 2 K with an intrinsic contribution of 155 S/cm, which has nearly constant variation with temperature.

Moreover, the efficiency of the transverse current generation therein can be as large as 18.4% at low temperatures; this is an order of magnitude larger than the anomalous Hall angle in conventional ferromagnetic materials, such as Fe or Fe-based alloys. Furthermore, using the Boltzmann transport equation and a tight-binding model, we conclude that the asymmetric group velocities on the Fermi surface are the origin of this crystal-induced transverse current in γ-FeMn.

abstract={Thanks to the nearsightedness principle, the low-energy electronic structure of solids can be represented by localized states such as the Wannier functions. Wannier functions are actively being applied to a wide range of phenomena in condensed matter systems. However, the Wannier-function-based representation is limited to a small number of bands and thus cannot describe the change of wave functions due to various kinds of perturbations, which require sums over an infinite number of bands. Here, we introduce the concept of the Wannier function perturbation, which provides a localized representation of wave function perturbations. Wannier function perturbation theory allows efficient calculation of numerous quantities involving wave function perturbation, among which we provide three applications. First, we calculate the temperature-dependent indirect optical absorption spectra of silicon near the absorption edge nonadiabatically, i.e., differentiating phonon-absorption and phonon-emission processes, and without arbitrary temperature-dependent shifts in energy. Second, we establish a theory to calculate the shift spin conductivity without any band-truncation error. Unlike the shift charge conductivity, an exact calculation of the shift spin conductivity is not possible within the conventional Wannier function methods because it cannot be obtained from geometric quantities for low-energy bands. We apply the theory to monolayer WTe2. Third, we calculate the spin Hall conductivity of the same material again without any band-truncation error. Wannier function perturbation theory is a versatile method that can be readily applied to calculate a wide range of quantities related to various kinds of perturbations. © 2021 authors.

abstract={Electric currents carrying a net spin polarization are widely used in spintronics, whereas globally spin-neutral currents are expected to play no role in spin-dependent phenomena. Here we show that, in contrast to this common expectation, spin-independent conductance in compensated antiferromagnets and normal metals can be efficiently exploited in spintronics, provided their magnetic space group symmetry supports a non-spin-degenerate Fermi surface. Due to their momentum-dependent spin polarization, such antiferromagnets can be used as active elements in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) and produce a giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Using RuO2 as a representative compensated antiferromagnet exhibiting spin-independent conductance along the [001] direction but a non-spin-degenerate Fermi surface, we design a RuO2/TiO2/RuO2 (001) AFMTJ, where a globally spin-neutral charge current is controlled by the relative orientation of the Néel vectors of the two RuO2 electrodes, resulting in the TMR effect as large as ~500%. These results are expanded to normal metals which can be used as a counter electrode in AFMTJs with a single antiferromagnetic layer or other elements in spintronic devices. Our work uncovers an unexplored potential of the materials with no global spin polarization for utilizing them in spintronics. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Magnets with topological band crossings serve as a good material platform for such control, because their topological band degeneracy can be readily tuned by spin configurations, dramatically modulating electronic conduction3–10. Here we propose that the topological nodal-line degeneracy of spin-polarized bands in magnetic semiconductors induces an extremely large angular response of magnetotransport. Taking a layered ferrimagnet, Mn3Si2Te6, and its derived compounds as a model system, we show that the topological band degeneracy, driven by chiral molecular orbital states, is lifted depending on spin orientation, which leads to a metal–insulator transition in the same ferrimagnetic phase. The resulting variation of angular magnetoresistance with rotating magnetization exceeds a trillion per cent per radian, which we call colossal angular magnetoresistance. Our findings demonstrate that magnetic nodal-line semiconductors are a promising platform for realizing extremely sensitive spin- and orbital-dependent functionalities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={A well-established result in condensed matter physics states that materials crystallizing in symmetry groups containing glide reflection symmetries possess nodal lines on the energy bands. These nodal lines are topologically protected and appear on the fixed planes of the reflection in reciprocal space. In the presence of inversion symmetry, the energy bands are degenerate and the band crossings on the fixed plane may be one-dimensional, or may intersect in points, including the case of empty intersection. In the latter case, the crossing is partially or totally avoided, thus producing lines on reciprocal space where the energy gap may be small, and in the former, the nodal lines will endure, thus producing Dirac or double nodal lines. In addition, if the material crystallizes in a ferromagnetic phase where the glide reflection symmetry is broken, the nodal lines hybridize, thus defining lines in reciprocal space where the energy gap may be small. In this work, we concentrate our efforts on the study of nodal lines that hybridize due to magnetization; we have coined the term of quasinodal lines for those lines in reciprocal space where the energy gap is small (less than what can be detected experimentally ∼25 meV). We study magnetic trifluorides and trioxides which crystallize in magnetic space groups 167.107 and 161.71 and we show the existence of quasinodal lines on these materials. We furthermore show that whenever the quasinodal lines are located around the Fermi level then interesting charge and spin transport effects are induced and can be used to detect experimentally these lines. Of particular interest are the half-metallic ferromagnetic phases of PdF3 and LiCuF3 where the large signal of the anomalous Hall conductance is due to the presence of the quasinodal lines on the Fermi level. © 2021 American Physical Society.},

Focusing specifically on PT-symmetric crystalline solids with negligible spin-orbit coupling, we find that such triple points can be stabilized by little groups containing a three-, four-, or sixfold rotation axis, and we develop a classification of all possible triple points as type A vs type B according to the absence vs presence of attached nodal-line arcs. Furthermore, by employing the recently discovered non-Abelian band topology, we argue that a rotation-symmetry-breaking strain transforms type-A triple points into multiband nodal links. Although multiband nodal-line compositions were previously theoretically conceived and related to topological monopole charges, a practical condensed-matter platform for their manipulation and inspection has hitherto been missing. By reviewing the known triple-point materials with weak spin-orbit coupling and by performing first-principles calculations to predict new ones, we identify suitable candidates for the realization of multiband nodal links in applied strain. In particular, we report that an ideal compound to study this phenomenon is Li2NaN, in which the conversion of triple points to multiband nodal links facilitates a largely tunable density of states and optical conductivity with doping and strain, respectively. © 2021 American Physical Society.},

journal = {Materials Research Express},
abstract = {Janus transition metal dichalcogenides, with intrinsic mirror asymmetry, exhibit a wide array of interesting properties. In this work, we study Janus monolayers derived from WTe2 using first-principles and tight-binding calculations. We discover that WSeTe and WSTe are topologically trivial, in contrast to the parent quantum spin Hall insulator WTe2. Motivated by the growing interest in non-linear Hall effect, which also requires asymmetric structures, we investigate the Berry curvature and its dipole in these Janus systems and find that they exhibit strikingly large values of Berry curvature dipole, despite being in the topologically trivial phase. We track down the origin of this behaviour and put forth a low-energy massive Dirac model to understand the central features of our ab inito computations. Our predictions introduce Janus monolayers as promising new platforms for exploring as well as engineering non-linear Hall effect.}

title = {Topological properties of bulk and bilayer 2M WS2: a first-principles study},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Recently discovered 2M phase of bulk WS2 was observed to exhibit superconductivity with a critical temperature of 8.8 K, the highest reported among superconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. Also predicted to support protected surface states, it could be a potential topological superconductor. In the present study, we perform a detailed first-principles analysis of bulk and bilayer 2M WS2. We report a comprehensive investigation of the bulk phase, comparing structural and electronic properties obtained from different exchange correlation functionals to the experimentally reported values. By calculation of the Z 2 invariant and surface states, we give support for its non-trivial band nature. Based on the insights gained from the analysis of the bulk phase, we predict bilayer 2M WS2 as a new two-dimensional topological material. We demonstrate its dynamical stability from first-principles phonon computations and present its electronic properties, highlighting the band inversions between the W d and S p states. By means of Z 2 invariant computations and a calculation of the edge states, we show that bilayer 2M WS2 exhibits protected, robust edge states. The broken inversion symmetry in this newly proposed bilayer also leads to the presence of Berry curvature dipole and resulting non-linear responses. We compute the Berry curvature distribution and the dipole as a function of Fermi energy. We propose that Berry curvature dipole signals, which are absent in the centrosymmetric bulk 2M WS2, can be signatures of the bilayer. We hope our predictions lead to the experimental realization of this as-yet-undiscovered two-dimensional topological material.}
