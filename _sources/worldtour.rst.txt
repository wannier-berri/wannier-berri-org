**************************
WannierBerri World Tour
**************************

During the nearest years I plan to spend more time travelling and making contact with the research groups which are using (or willing to) WanierBerri.
Therefore, if you have interest in me visiting your group, **I am happy to receive an invitation** for a visit.
During a visit I may give a tutorial on the code, talk on my current research, and we may discuss future developments and possible ways of collaboration.

Applications from remote regions are very welcome. Dates, duration and program of a visit are upon agreement.

Generally it is assumed that the inviting party pays the travel expenses. However if you are unable to cover them, still feel free to contact me, and we will look for solution.

Feel free to share this information with anyone who might be interested.

Best Regards,

Stepan Tsirkin.
